# minimalism

minimalism is a service-based PHP MVC framework for fast web, api and cli applications. It has been designed to offer 
a simple approach to developing softwares. Developers can focus on writing **models** (and **views** in case of web
applications) and forget everything that goes behind the scene.

## Status

This framework is fastly evolving and changing. As it is a personal project evolved in something more than a pet
project, you should expect quick changes. Every time the structure of the core component of minimalism is changed, a
new major version will be released.

# Modules and Services

Every element inside minimalism is either a **module** or a **service**.

## Modules

A module is a core element which defines the type of models and controllers used. It is the foundation of the
logical structure of an application.

Every application can have only one model.

To use minimalism, it is sufficient to require the module via `composer`.

## Services

A service is a system with a single entry point which offers a series of functionalities.
Each service defines the configurations required and implements its functionalities.

A service is always instantiates during bootstrap, and ready to be used during the code execution.


# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

## Installing

To use minimalism, you need to specify which module your app will use. So far the supported modules are 
[minimalism-module-jsonapi-api](https://github.com/carlonicora/minimalism-module-jsonapi-api) to create APIs based on
[{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org), [minimalism-module-cli](https://github.com/carlonicora/minimalism-module-cli) to
create CLI applications and
[minimalism-module-jsonapi-web](https://github.com/carlonicora/minimalism-module-jsonapi-api) to create websites that
leverage the [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org) standard.

To start using minimalism, you need to require one of these three in your `composer.json` file

```
$ composer require carlonicora/minimalism-module-jsonapi-web
```

```json
{
    "require": {
        "carlonicora/minimalism-module-jsonapi-web": "~1.0"
    }
}
```
